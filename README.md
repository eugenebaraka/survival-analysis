# Examining Survival in a Randomized Comparison of Treatments for Prostatic Cancer 

This repository contains the analysis and models used to examine survival outcomes in a randomized comparison of treatments for prostatic cancer. The primary goal is to evaluate the impact of different treatment levels and various covariates on survival time using Cox Proportional-Hazards (CoxPH) models and explore Time dependent and non-linear effects that challenge the PH assumption of the traditional CoxPH modelling .
